print(2 + 1, 3 - 4, 7 * 9, 9 / 3, 7 % 4, 2 ** 3) 
# % sign is the mod operator, diplays remainder
# ** is to the power

print(2 + 10 * 10 + 3)
print((2 + 10) * (10 + 3))
# print 1 will use basic order of operations (* --> +)

print(0.2 + 0.1 - 0.3)
# this will not result in 0 since we are using folating point numbers
